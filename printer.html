        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>Enjoy beyond gigabit speeds with the ARCHER AX10 AX1500 Wireless Dual-Band Gigabit Router from TP-Link. This router supports the Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) protocol for wireless network data transfer speeds of up to 1501 Mb/s. That speed is split between dual band technology, with up to 1201 Mb/s on the 5 GHz band and up to 300 Mb/s on the 2.4 GHz band. To further increase data throughput, this wireless router supports 2x2 MU-MIMO, OFDMA, and beamforming technologies. In addition to wireless connectivity, the AX10 supports wired devices as well. Four RJ-45 Ethernet ports on the back of the router support gigabit speeds. TP-Link has given the Archer AX10 a 1.5 GHz tri-core processor to help ensure that all of your devices will enjoy a smooth and buffer-free experience. TP-Link worked to make setup equally as smooth with the Tether app for iOS and Android devices. If you prefer, you can still always use the built-in web interface to adjust networking settings.</p>
        <p>•	Wi-Fi 6 Technology—Archer AX10 comes equipped with latest wireless technology, Wi-Fi 6, for faster speeds, greater capacity and reduced network congestion.2 Wi-Fi 6 delivers a huge boost in speed and total capacity. Get on the latest WiFi technology to wipe out all the annoying slowdown, and enjoy the future network that loads faster and connects more.</p>
        <p>•	Next-Gen 1.5 Gbps Speeds—Archer AX10 dual-band router reaches fast speeds up to 1.5 Gbps (1201 Mbps on 5 GHz band and 300 Mbps on 2.4 GHz band)1</p>
        <p>•	Connect More Devices than Ever Before—Wi-Fi 6 technology simultaneously communicates more data to more devices using OFDMA and MU-MIMO while reducing lag. Add more WiFi devices without dragging down performance. OFDMA allows multiple devices to use one band at the same time, enabling your WiFi to bear more devices compared to the same speed level Wi-Fi 5 router.</p>
